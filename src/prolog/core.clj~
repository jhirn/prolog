; notes to myself about types in clojure.
;(type (cons 4 '())) => clojure.lang.Cons
;(type '()) => clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList
;(type '(1)) => clojure.lang.PersistentList
;(type '[]) => clojure.lang.PersistentVector
;(type '[1]) => clojure.lang.PersistentVector
;(type (list)) => clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList
;(type (cons 4 [])) => clojure.lang.Cons


; consp is to replace coll?
; coll? doesn't return false if something is an empty list or nil. I wanted that distinction
;(coll? '()) => true
;(coll? '[]) => true
;(coll? (cons 4 '())) => true
;(coll? (cons 4 '[])) => true
;(coll? (sean-cons 4 5)) => true
(defn consp [x]
  (cond
   (= x '()) false ; do we ever have the empty list instead of nil?
   (coll? x) true ; this makes sense.
   ;(type? x clojure.lang.Cons) true ; hopefully we don't need this line.. put it back in if necessary
   true false ; if you pass anything else other than a list, it's definitely not a list
   ))


; cdr returns the same thing for both [] lists & () lists & leaves the type intact
;(cdr '[]) => nil
;(cdr '()) => nil
;(cdr '[1]) => nil
;(cdr '(1)) => ()
;(cdr '[1 2]) => 2
;(cdr '(1 2)) => (2)

; it's a replacement for rest which does undesired behavior:
;(rest '[]) => ()
;(rest '()) => ()
;(rest '[1]) => ()
;(rest '(1)) => ()
;(rest '[1 2]) => (2)
;(rest '(1 2)) => (2)
;(rest '[1 2 3]) => (2 3)
